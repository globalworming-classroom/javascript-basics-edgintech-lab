# javascript-basics
A javascript tutorial to be used with github classrooms

You can get your own repository to work with by going to [https://classroom.github.com/a/HrmGXqZ9](https://classroom.github.com/a/HrmGXqZ9) and get help and feedback through a feedback pull request. If you are part of the [serenity dojo](https://serenitydojo.teachable.com/) you can find videos where I go through the code and tasks, and you can directly message me.

## Get started
When you got your own repository to work with, clone it and open the [index.html](./index.html) in your browser. Most chapters will have some example code, you can run this code in your browsers console, check your browsers [development tools](https://javascript.info/devtools). Most chapters have a coding task. You need to change the source code of the file you are seeing with a code editor. You need to solve the task to progress to the next chapter. Or don't, feel free to cheat or just go to other chapters üòÅ
